# Ubuntu EmulationStation automatic configuration
Quickly through together a shell script to automate the installation and configuration of EmulationStation and various emulators for x86/x64 architecture. Used RetroPie for Raspi and noticed that there's nothing similar for standard hardware. This is a first alpha release and will get you set up, but you need to configure controllers manually in each emulator, I'll fix this soon.
